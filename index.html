            <p class="history__paragraph">Inside Out (titled Intensa-Mente en Hispanoamérica and Del Reverse (Inside Out) in Spain) is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Its plot takes place in the mind of a girl, named Riley Anderson (Kaitlyn Dias), where five emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear / Fear (Bill Hader), Fury / Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust / Disgust (Mindy Kaling) - seek to guide her in her day-to-day life. The film was directed and written by Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen, produced by Jonas Rivera and with music by Michael Giacchino Docter began developing Inside Out, his third feature film, in 2009 after observing changes in his daughter's personality. The producers consulted with numerous psychologists and neurologists, including Dacher Keltner6 of the University of California at Berkeley, who helped revise the story by emphasizing the findings in neuropsychology that indicate that human emotions are reflected in and can be moderated by interpersonal relationships. .7 The film premiered on June 19, 2015, although it was previously shown during the 68th Cannes Film Festival in May, accompanied by the short film Lava, directed by James Ford Murphy. After its premiere, it received positive reviews, with special attention to the performances of Poehler, Smith and Richard Kind, its soundtrack and the themes it addresses. It grossed more than $ 857 million worldwide5 — at $ 90.4 million, it had the highest grossing opening weekend for an original film. On the other hand, it received multiple awards and nominations, such as the Golden Globe, the Film Critics Award, the Annie Award and the Oscar for Best Animated Film. In 2016, it was named by the BBC as one of the 100 best films of the 21st century.8</p>
            <p class="history__paragraph history__paragraph--blue">Ah Iceland, land of ice and fire and ridiculously long words that no visitor can pronounce, giving Welsh a run for its money! Iceland has a very volcanic history (there aren’t many places with black sand beaches) which has shaped a unique and beautiful landscape. But, we’re here to talk specifically about the craters and lagoons. We had to include the image above, with its surprisingly vivid colours and sweeping view into the mountains. You can find similar mountain lakes, left behind by glaciers, far more widely than just Iceland. Glacial valleys can be seen from the Lake District to the Alps and right across mountainous areas in the world. At least, any place where there was ice millions of years ago.</p>
            <p class="history__paragraph">When people think of beautiful beaches, they’re probably thinking of long stretches of white sand that meet turquoise blue oceans. Maybe a turtle or two. But the rock formations around the coast are equally beautiful, shaped by thousands of years of waves. Because really, that’s kind of all sand is: really, really small grains of rock… mostly. Let’s not talk about the parrotfish poop (look it up). We just liked this dramatic picture of a coastal cave at a mystery location on the coast of California. But every island has a coast, if you can just find the edges. So many coastlines are beautiful in their own right.</p>
